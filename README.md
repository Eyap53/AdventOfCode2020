# AdventOfCode2020

![CI](https://github.com/Eyap53/AdventOfCode2020/workflows/CI/badge.svg)


This repo contains my attempt at [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) with C# and the help of the [AoCHelper](https://github.com/eduherminio/AoCHelper) template for ease of writting.

I started this AdventOfCode using python, so in this repo you will only find the solution from day 11 and after (in C#). You can find my solutions for the previous days here : [AdventOfCode2020-python](https://github.com/Eyap53/AdventOfCode2020-python).
